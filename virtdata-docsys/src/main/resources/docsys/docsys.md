# DocSys

This is a documentation system that does the following:
1. It allows docs to be hosted as markdown within the source of an
   artifact.
2. It allows for multiple artifacts to provide their markdown docs in a
   single view.
3. It allows both static content as well as services to be combined into
   applications which live on both the client and the server.

For now, the docs on docsys itself will be very terse. This is just a
how-to section to get started.
