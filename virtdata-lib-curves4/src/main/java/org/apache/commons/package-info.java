/**
 * This package is an import of some org.apache.commons source trees.
 * Once the state of the newer o.a.c.math4 and distributions modules is stable,
 * these will be removed and the release artifacts will be used.
 * The enclosed packages were included here as the least worst of several options,
 * given the confluence of JPMS, the status of the math4 repos, and the need
 * to access stable CDF functions across the extant distributions.
