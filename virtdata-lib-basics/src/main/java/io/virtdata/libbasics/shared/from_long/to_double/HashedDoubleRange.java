/*
 * <p>This simulates a uniform sample from a range of double values
 * via long hashing. This function attempts to take a double
 * unit interval value from a long/long division over the whole
 * range of long values but via double value types, thus providing
 * a very linear sample. This means that the range of double
 * values to be accessed will not fall along all possible doubles,
 * but will still provide suitable values for ranges close to
 * high-precision points in the IEEE floating point number line.
 * This suffices for most reasonable ranges in practice outside
 * of scientific computing, where large exponents put adjacent
 * IEEE floating point values much further apart.</p>
 *
 * <p>This should be consider the default double range sampling
 * function for most uses, when the exponent is not needed for
 * readability.</p>
