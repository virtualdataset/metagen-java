/**
 * <p>This class implements an obtuse way of avoiding autoboxing and M:N type
 * mapping complexity by way of doublish dispatch. It was preferred over a more
 * generalized reflection and annotation-based approach. If it gets too verbose,
 * (for some definition of "too"), then it may be refactored.</p>
 *
 * <p>The primary goal of this approach is to allow for primitive-level
 * lambdas when function are composed together. This will allow for significant
 * performance gains when there are only a few steps in a composed function
 * which are non-primitive, which is the general case.</p>
 *
 * <p>Composition should be supported between all primitive functions
 * for types listed in TypeMap, as well as generic functions, with generic
 * functions as the last resort.</p>
